/**
 * An object of this class is used to record obervations of 
 * vehicles, say for the purposes of monitoring road use. 
 *
 * Essentially, an Observations object stores a sequence of vehicle registrations 
 * in the order in which the corresponding vehicles were observed e.g.     
 * Say an observation of vehicle CA976543WP is followed by an observation
 * of CDS791 MP,
 * followed by vehicle CHZ897 L, followed by another observation of vehicle
 * CA9765 WP
 * then the sequence stored would be <<CA9765 WP,CDS791 MP,CHZ897 L,CA9765 WP>>.
 *
 * A vehicle may be observed more than once.
